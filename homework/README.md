# General Homework Guidelines

## The following guidelines are expected for all homework submissions:

* All homework must be typed. Homework which is not typed will be returned ungraded and will be subject to the late homework guidelines as set out on the syllabus page. PLEASE DO NOT scribble something on lined paper and rip it out of your spiral notebook — hanging chads went out with the presidential election in 2000.
* I don't care too much about what font you use or how large your margins are; however, you might want to check out a monospaced font for typing code, as it will be easy to see the indentations.
* Speaking of indenting, PLEASE DON'T USE TABS TO INDENT YOUR CODE. Tabs can often get interpreted differently by different computers and applications, and could make code that is nicely formatted on your computer look all over the map on my computer or printer. USE SPACES INSTEAD. You can set up almost every modern text editor to insert spaces whenever you press the TAB key, or you can simply pound the spacebar.
* **Work with a partner**. I can't stress this enough; part of this policy is <u><i>don't split up the work – <b>WORK TOGETHER</b> on the assignment</i></u>; <b>DO NOT DIVIDE UP THE WORK!</b>. Doing assignments this way mimics an industry code development model called pair programming which is part of the Extreme Programming [Agile] software development method. Feel free to collaborate in your pairs as much as you want, doing the entire assignment together. Only submit ONE copy for the both of you.
* **DO NOT share your work between groups**. Doing so will count as plagiarism. If you wish to discuss solutions with another group over coffee in the Lair, that's fine as long as it is kept at the conceptual and you don't share your code between groups. Each group needs to turn in its own version of the solutions.
* Repeat: you only need to turn in one copy per group.
* Submit your homework through GitHub, in your repository, <u><i>and be sure to make me a contributor so I have access</i></u>. I cannot evaluate what I cannot see! If I can't upload to your repo, you will not get an evaluation for the assignment.
