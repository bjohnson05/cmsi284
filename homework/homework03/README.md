# Problems for Assignment #3
## Learning Outcomes:
<blockquote>
  1. Understanding different number representations<br />
  1. Practice with the different common number bases used by computers<br />
  1. Practice translating values between different bases<br />
  1. Practice translating values between different representations<br />
  1. Practice/understanding of carry, overflow, saturated, and modular computer arithmetic
</blockquote>

Please do all these problems WITHOUT using a computer or calculator.

The purpose of these exercises is to help you develop your skill.

Taking the time to practice will give you a better ability and understanding of the material.

Remember that the prefix "0x" or "0X" indicates that a value is shown in hexadecimal [base 16].
