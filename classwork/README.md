# README FILE FOR CLASSWORK FOLDERS
I am planning to put solutions into these directories for the in-class exercises that happen at the end of each week.  These exercises are designed to give you some practice with the concepts that are presented in class during each week.  **THEY ARE NOT FOR SCORE!**  The exercises are strictly for your own practice and experience.

There is also **no due date** for these exercises.  You do NOT have to turn them in if you don't want to do so.  If I *do* see you have turned something in, I will check it out, reading through it.  If I see something that is worthy of comment I will put a text file in the directory.  I may comment on an area that needs improvement, but I may also comment on something that is done particularly well!

Either way, the intent is for you to **get practice** to help you understand and gain a facility with the aspects of the computer systems we see during the semester.
